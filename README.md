# Lockyblocks Land

This is a Bedrock Minecraft world with three collectable challenges that unlock unique block items.

The player kills block mobs to yield locky blocks. These can be used for building and to complete the Lockyblock collection.

The rainbow Lockyblock, when held, terraforms the landscape into lockyblocks.
